# What is Deadlock?

*Deadlock* (2024) is an online **multiplayer shooter video game**, akin to games like *Overwatch*, *Call of Duty*, or *Halo*. Deadlock is free to  play; it is currently in a [pre-release test phase](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1422450/Deadlock/).

Deadlock has a **unique objective** or "game-mode" that sets it apart from those other shooting-based games:
- It's *not* 'Free For All' (most kills wins).
- It's *not* 'King Of The Hill' (fight to hold a critical location).
- It's *not* 'Payload' (escort a civilian to safety).

Deadlock's game-mode is ~~"Tug-Of-War"~~ **"Push-Of-War"**:
- Each team must collectively **push through the opposing team's defenses and destroy their home-base!** (while simultaneously protecting their own base)
- The "front line" of the fight moves back and forth as teams start to break through defenses and gain/lose/re-gain the advantage.

*(Note: "Push-Of-War" is more commonly known as "**MOBA**" -- a thriving genre of video games)*

Deadlock is made by **Valve**, a studio known for hit titles including MOBA game ***Dota 2*** **(2013)**, which is the **3rd-most active game** on Steam at time of writing.  Dota 2's annual tournament, *The International*, boasted a $40,000,000 prize pool in 2021 and drew a peak 2.7 million viewers.

> *Content Warning: Deadlock does not have an ESRB rating yet. The game features gun violence, but its magic-fantasy cartoon style is hardly graphic; frankly it resembles a sport - not a war simulation. Tobacco and alcohol references present. Player interactions in any online video game may include bad language or behavior.*

# How do you play Deadlock?

You and your teammates have **two key priorities**:

## Priority #1: Blow up the Objectives

To win the game, **shoot the enemy base**! 

Be warned: there's a series of **guard towers** in your way. Work to shoot them down first, then shoot the base.

Meanwhile, you'll have to deal with the **enemy players** and their army of small **AI-controlled soldiers (called "minions")**, both of which are shooting at you!
- It's usually best to **shoot them back first** before going after their guard towers and base. If you can force them to retreat, you'll earn a short time-out to focus on their defenses before they come back!
- You'll also be supported by your own set of minions, fighting alongside you. You're a superhero, and they're your backup.

## Priority #2: Earn Money

You are very weak at the beginning of the game -- the enemy guard towers and base will be tough to break at first. **Get stronger by earning money** to spend on upgrades for your abilities *before* you start focusing on the objectives.

You **earn this money by shooting enemy minions**. This may seem like a strange way to earn money, but it's the signature game mechanic of the popular MOBA game genre!

While your primary goal is destroying enemy buildings, you should actually spend most of your time earning money, since the upgrades you buy will make securing those objectives so much easier.

# Dive In!

Focus on earning money first. **To start, you'll be assigned to one of the three major roads (called "lanes")** that connect your base and the enemy base. Hang out in your lane for a while, working with your lane partner to shoot enemy minions and protect your own minions.

After 10-15 minutes, your teammates will start to **gradually group up and work together to blow up guard towers** -- you'll see this happening on your city map. You should now leave your lane and join them; in this late phase of the game, sticking together will keep you safe and help your team achieve the objectives!

**The game usually lasts ~30 minutes** before one team has managed to destroy their opposition's base (some games are faster/slower).

Good luck!
