# What is Deadlock?

*Deadlock* (2024) is an online **team-based shooter video game**, akin to games like *Overwatch*, *Call of Duty*, and *Halo*. Deadlock is free to play† - it is currently in a [pre-release test phase](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1422450/Deadlock/). GameSpot news has an [11-minute youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c59Nc0BWtOc) that is a fantastic overview of the game.

Deadlock has a **unique objective** or "game-mode" that sets it apart from those other shooting-based games:
- It's *not* 'Free For All' (most kills wins).
- It's *not* 'King Of The Hill' (secure a critical location).
- It's *not* 'Payload' (escort a civilian to safety).

Deadlock's game-mode is Tug-... no, it's **"Push-Of-War"**:
- Two teams try to **push through the opposing team's defenses and destroy their home-base!** (while protecting their own base)
- The **"front line" moves back and forth** as teams start to break through eachother's defenses and gain/lose/re-gain the advantage.
- Diverse player roles and a mirrored city layout are central to the game-mode.

*(Note: "Push-Of-War" is more commonly known as "**MOBA**" -- a very popular genre of video games)*

Deadlock is made by **Valve**, a studio known for hit titles including *Counter Strike 2* (2023) and *Dota 2* (2013), which are at time of writing the **1st- and 2nd-most popular games** on Steam, the largest PC gaming platform. *Dota 2* is a competitive MOBA; its annual tournament *The International* boasted a $40,000,000 prize pool in 2021 and drew a peak 2.7 million viewers.

> *Content Warning: Deadlock does not have an ESRB rating yet. My amateur opinion is "Teen". The game features magic/cartoon gun violence. It's not graphic. The game resembles a sport (like paintball), not a war simulation. Tobacco and alcohol references present. Like on every online platform, social interactions may include bad language or behavior.*

# How do you play Deadlock?

You and your teammates have **two key priorities**:

## Priority #1: Blow up the Objectives

To win the game, **shoot the enemy base**!

Be warned: there's a series of **guard towers** in your way. Work to shoot those down first, then shoot the base.

Meanwhile, you'll also have to deal with the **enemy players** and their army of small **AI-controlled soldiers (called "minions")**, both of which are shooting at you!
- It's usually best to **shoot them back first** before going after the guard towers and base. If you can force them to retreat, you'll earn a short time-out to work on your objective unhindered before they come back!
- You'll be supported by *your own* teammates and minions, fighting alongside you. You and your teammates are superheroes; the minions are your backup.

## Priority #2: Earn Money

You are very weak at the beginning of the game -- the enemy defenses will be tough to break at first. **Earn money to get stronger** -- purchase upgrades to your weapons and magic *before* you start focusing on the objectives.

**Earn this money by shooting enemy minions**. This may seem like a strange way to earn money, but it's the signature game mechanic of the MOBA game genre!

Your primary goal is to destroy the enemy buildings, but you should actually spend most of your time earning money. The upgrades you buy will make securing those objectives so much easier.

# Dive In!

**You and an assigned partner will patrol one of the major roads** that connect your base to the enemy base. There are three of these roads: "Yellow Lane", "Blue Lane", and "Green Lane". Stay put in your assigned lane for a while -- work with your partner to shoot enemy minions, buy upgrades, and stay alive.

After about 10 minutes, you'll be strong enough to go **blow up enemy guard towers with your team** in *all* of the lanes. Move as a group! Avoid getting caught out by yourself; don't face the whole enemy team alone. Teamwork will help you stay alive and achieve the objectives!

**The game usually lasts ~25 minutes.** It ends when one team has managed to destroy the other team's base.

Good luck!
